@echo This is an explaination of something I call "Steam Validation" >> "%USERPROFILE%\desktop\What is Steam Validation and how does it work.txt"
@echo when downloading an older version of a game, you would have thought that it would run undetected  >> "%USERPROFILE%\desktop\What is Steam Validation and how does it work.txt"
@echo But no >> "%USERPROFILE%\desktop\What is Steam Validation and how does it work.txt"
@echo You obviously need to own the actual game, or at the very least, have a steam library share so you can actually play the current version >> "%USERPROFILE%\desktop\What is Steam Validation and how does it work.txt"
@echo But thats just one layer protection >> "%USERPROFILE%\desktop\What is Steam Validation and how does it work.txt"
@echo Some games have a more picky protection which I call Steam Validation >> "%USERPROFILE%\desktop\What is Steam Validation and how does it work.txt"
@echo games like Trailmakers need to be validated by Steam, and you can do so by placing the folder in the steamapps\common folder and run it by the executable >> "%USERPROFILE%\desktop\What is Steam Validation and how does it work.txt"
@echo The game will then (if I have access to game via owning or family share, placed in the steamapps\common and run by exe) be validated and will reboot under steam >> "%USERPROFILE%\desktop\What is Steam Validation and how does it work.txt"
@echo if the game IS NOT run by exe it will only update it to the latest version >> "%USERPROFILE%\desktop\What is Steam Validation and how does it work.txt"
@echo if the game is not inside of the steamapps\common folder, but I have access to it, It will launch the current version under steam >> "%USERPROFILE%\desktop\What is Steam Validation and how does it work.txt"
@echo if I DONT have access in any way, it will open the steam store >> "%USERPROFILE%\desktop\What is Steam Validation and how does it work.txt"
@echo like i said, picky >> "%USERPROFILE%\desktop\What is Steam Validation and how does it work.txt"
@echo fortunately, some games only have one layer of protection mentioned above >> "%USERPROFILE%\desktop\What is Steam Validation and how does it work.txt"
@echo that is steam validation and how it works >> "%USERPROFILE%\desktop\What is Steam Validation and how does it work.txt"
@echo a text file has been placed on your desktop
